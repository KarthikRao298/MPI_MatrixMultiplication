# Objective

- The problem is to compute iterated matrix multiplication defined by x(k) = Ax(k−1), where A is a random matrix of size n × n and x(k) is a vector of size n. Pick x(0) randomly.
- The data is to be partitioned using block decomposition partitioning scheme.
- Perform strong scaling & weak scaling experiment to compute x(20) from 1 core to 32 cores.
